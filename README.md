This project is an E-commerce app, It was really challenging to implement the functionality and design. I am not a designer but, 
I tried to make it professional and beautiful. I took the images from Pixabay.com and Pexels.com.
I also included a payment functionality using Stripe, and useContext for the cart system. I created the database in MongoDB.

This project was made with React, Nodejs, Mongodb, Expressjs, and Stripe.
